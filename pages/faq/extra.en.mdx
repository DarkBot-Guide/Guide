## 1. NPC priority (same for boxes)

> A -5 Priority
> B 0 Priority

Goes for A first
 
> A 2 Priority
> B -6 Priority

Goes for B first
 
> A 0 Priority
> B -20 Priority (Appears after a while in Sight)

Goes for B
 
But in this case even if Bot is shooting right now A with 50% Health left and B appears in sight it will stop shooting A and move to B

If priority difference is like 20 priorities bellow from others that one will be Always preferred no matter what Bot is shooting
 
> A 15 Priority
> B 0 Priority

This one kinda complicated/tricky. If A has less than 50%▼ HP continue killing it else above 50%▲ HP go kill B.
 
Here more Information about that. Thanks to Punisher

> NPC that is currently Locked and have Full HP getting 10 Extra Priority.
> Then every Missing 10% HP of Locked NPC give 1 Extra Priority.
 
Example:
1. Locked NPC with 50% HP gives 15 Extra Priority.
2. Locked NPC with 20% HP 18 Extra Priority.
