## 1. NPC priority (same for boxes)

1. Example #1
```bash
A -5 Priority
B 0 Priority
```
Goes for A first

2. Example #2
```bash 
A 2 Priority
B -6 Priority
```
Goes for B first

3. Example #3
```bash 
A 0 Priority
B -20 Priority (Appears after a while in Sight)
```
Goes for B
 
But in this case even if Bot is shooting right now A with 50% Health left and B appears in sight it will stop shooting A and move to B
If priority difference is like 20 priorities bellow from others that one will be Always preferred no matter what Bot is shooting

4. Example #4
```bash
A 15 Priority
B 0 Priority
```
This one kinda complicated/tricky
If A has less than 50%▼ HP continue killing it else above 50%▲ HP go kill B.

Here more Information about that (thanks to Punika):
1. NPC that is currently Locked and have Full HP getting 10 Extra Priority.
2. Then every Missing 10% HP of Locked NPC give 1 Extra Priority.
 
Example:
```bash
Locked NPC with 50% HP gives 15 Extra Priority.
Locked NPC with 20% HP 18 Extra Priority.
```
