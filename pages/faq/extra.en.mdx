## 1. NPC priority (same for boxes)

|    Prio A    |    Prio B    |   Goes to   |
| :----------- | :----------: | ----------: |
|      -5      |      0       |      A      |
|       2      |     -6       |      B      |
|       0      |     -20      |      B      |   **B** appears after a while in sight

But in this case even if Bot is shooting right now A with 50% Health left and B appears in sight it will stop shooting A and move to B.

If priority difference is like 20 priorities bellow from others that one will be Always preferred no matter what Bot is shooting.

```bash
A  15 Priority
B  0  Priority
```
This one kinda complicated/tricky. If A has less than 50%▼ HP continue killing it else above 50%▲ HP go kill B.

Here more Information about that. Thanks to Punisher
```bash
1. NPC that is currently Locked and have Full HP getting 10 Extra Priority.
2. Then every Missing 10% HP of Locked NPC give 1 Extra Priority.
```
Example:
```bash
1. Locked NPC with 50% HP gives 15 Extra Priority.
2. Locked NPC with 20% HP 18 Extra Priority.
```
