- Remember to respect the rules of the server, in this channel you can only speak in English or Spanish and IT IS NOT A SUPPORT CHANNEL! That's what the #support-es channel is for

5. Access to the #plugins channel where contributors share their plugins for donors to use.
6. Access to the #experimental-downloads channel, in this channel the new versions that are being developed are shared, which means that they may contain new features or fixes to some bot bugs.

You will receive the range in a couple of minutes at the most, it usually arrives as soon as the transaction has been completed.

The link that it gives us is for the account with which we have written the command, this means, Diamond#3015 will receive the rank.

## 4. FAQ
1. Other than the benefits listed, do I get anything else?

- No, the donors only have the benefits that appear on the list, so they will not be attended by the supports with the highest priority or anything else.

2. An error appears on the page, what can I do?

- This means that the transaction could not be carried out, one of the reasons may be:
 1. Lack of balance
 2. Your card is not authorized to make payments online or your bank has rejected the transaction. I recommend that you contact the bank for help.

3. I can't write a private message to the bot.

- This happens because in the privacy options of the server, you have set that the members of the server cannot send you private messages.

To fix this, right click on the Server > Privacy > Allow private messages from server members
