            5. Make sure its the JDK not JRE
            6. Click OK

        3. Step #3

Reasons and solutions:
1. You are closing the popup window from the bot (a dark grey window that pops out just after running the bot) during the authorization process. DO NOT close it, since you will always get the mentioned error.
2. The browser you are currently using is not able to load the page. Set default browser to chrome - there you should authorize the bot seamlessly.
3. You are using a very aggressive AntiVirus that doesn't allow you to pass the authorization process - try to disable it for a moment.

## 7. Cannot login to the game - refreshing the login page or redirecting to the logout page just after clicking the login button.

Cause: security restrictions doesn't allow to set cookies in the browser, which are needed to access the backpage and run the game.

Solution: for any Windows Server OS:
 1. Open the Server Manager tab
 2. Navigate to Local Server
 3. Find and disable IE Enhanced Security Configuration
 4. Close all windows and check if you can log in to the game.

Solution: for all operating systems:
 1.  click menu start, type inetcpl.cpl and hit enter
 2. go to security, click trusted sites and add *.darkorbit.com to trusted sites
 3. close all windows and now, try to log in to the game
 ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to restart the bot to apply changes!

If it doesn't help and you are still facing the same issue, try to decrease the security level for the internet zone (inetcpl.cpl => security  -> internet, set it to medium or low).

## 8. The API you had selected is not able to load

‚ùå Error message: The API you had selected is not able to load. You probably do not have the required DLL in your lib folder.
Possible causes and solutions:

1. You have a 32-bit java version installed on your PC - reinstall Java or our Runtimes.

2. Your absolute (full) path to the DarkBot.jar file contains one or more national characters (such as ƒü, ≈û ƒ± etc.) which cannot be recognized properly and are converted to question marks.
For example:
The following path:    C:\users\kullanƒ±cƒ±\Desktop\Darkbot\lib
Will be converted to: C:\users\kullan?c?\Desktop\Darkbot\lib

üîπ So, the converted path is pointing to an invalid location, where the required .dll file cannot be found and that's the reason of this error.

Solution: Get rid of all national characters from your path by changing the name of all directories where they occur. If the actual name of the user on your computer contains mentioned characters (like in the example above) and you don't want to bother with renaming it, you can simply move the bot folder to any partition (For example to disk C:\) and run it there. 
 
3. The bot is loading the game forever after refresh

Solution: Clear cache and restart bot.

## 9. Failed to load config

This happens if you try to run the bot with Java 8. If are not donor, follow the instructions below.

1. Click Menu Start, type appwiz.cpl and hit Enter
2. Search for Java 8 and uninstall it
3. Download and install our runtime: https://darkbot.eu/downloads/Runtimes4DarkBot.exe, then run the bot again.
