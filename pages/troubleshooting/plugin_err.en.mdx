## 1. Loaded plugin doesn't appear in the plugins tab

 1. Make sure you put the plugin in a proper folder. All plugins should be placed in the folder named 'plugins'.
 2. If you loaded the plugin while the bot was running, click the reload icon (located in the upper right corner of the settings panel) or restart the bot.
  
 
## 2.The plugin is not working and its background in the plugins tab is red

 Error messages and solutions:
  
‚ùå Bot update required

  Cause: You loaded a plugin that was designed for a further bot version than you are actually using
  
  Solutions: 
  1. Remove the plugin from your plugins folder and get an older version of this plugin.
  2. Update the bot to the version that is supported by this plugin or just update to the latest one

  
‚ùå Invalid signature

Possible causes and solutions: 
1. GitHub servers are temporary down and it's not possible to verify a signature of the plugin. Before you go further, check the GitHub servers status (https://www.githubstatus.com/). If this is the case, just wait patiently until they fix their servers.
2. You loaded a plugin that comes from an untrusted source - someone sent it to you or you find it somewhere in the web. It's better to don't use these plugins!
3. Your IP has been blocked by GitHub servers or your internet provider restricted you access to the GitHub pages. Connect to internet from another IP, for example, share an internet connection using your phone or use proxy.

  
‚ùå The plugin is missing a plugin.json in the jar root

Reason: You put the .jar file that is not really a plugin for the bot. You can remove it from the plugins folder, because you won't be able to use it.
 
  
**üõ†Ô∏è The plugin's background is green, but some features are not working**
  
‚ùå Failed to load

Possible causes and solutions:
  1. The feature couldn't be loaded properly. Try to click the reload icon or restart the bot
  2. You loaded two (or more) different (or the same) versions of the same plugin to your bot. If this is the case, close the bot and remove all duplications from the plugins folder.
  
‚ùå Failed to tick

Possible solutions:
  1. Try to reload plugins or restart the bot
  2. Disable all other unnecessary plugins' features from the plugins tab, then restart the bot.
  3. Try the older/newer plugin version or use the older bot version, since older plugins may not work properly on the newer ones.
  
 
## 3. The checkbox next to the feature has been ticked, but you can't click the gear icon to configure it

Reason: The enabled feature is a module [M] that first must be chosen in the module selection. 

Solution:

1. Go to General Settings and select it, then go back and check if you can access the configuration. 
2. If not, go back to General settings and scroll down to the very bottom. The configuration section for this module should be there.
  
 
## 4. The kekka's kamikaze feature is not working 
 
üîπ The bot is not shooting aliens in the gate, just running away from them

Possible causes and solutions:
  1. You didn't specify a number of the P.E.T. kamikaze module or the number you provided is not adequate to the position of the kami module in the in-game pet module selection.
  2. You are using an unstable or exprerimental that uses a new P.E.T. module selection system (you can select a module from the list instead of typing a number of the module). The kekka's Galaxy Module doesn't support it, so you need to enable the Legacy PET mode in the bot settings to make the kami feature work properly.
  3. You didn't set the shield and HP range properly.
  4. Your ship HP or shield level is too low to use kami, for example, because your ship is not able to fill it up, since it's too slow and is constantly attacked by the aliens. Also. make sure you didn't set the Moth or Wheel as formation used to throw pet kamikaze, since they are constantly decreasing your shields level.
  
üîπ  The bot is only shooting aliens and doesn't use kamikaze

 Possible causes and solutions:
  1. You didn't enable and configured the kamikaze feature in the kekka's configuration section.
  2. You didn't specify on which NPCs should the kamikaze be used. To do it, go to the NPCs table, left click on the field in the extra column and add proper flags to the aliens you want to kami.
  3. You are using the Kekka Reloaded 1.1.8 where the kami feature is broken. Use Kekka Reloaded 1.0.4 instead. Go to the plugins channel and scroll up. You will find it there.
  
üîπ The bot chooses the kamikaze module, but P.E.T. behaves like in guard mode

 Possible causes and solutions:

  1.  The P.E.T's HP is too high to fire up (it must be lower than 10%).
