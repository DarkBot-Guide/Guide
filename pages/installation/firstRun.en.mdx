## First run

Run the darkbot by double clicking the Darkbot.jar file. When you do, this verification window will appear:

![firstRun](public/discordAuth.png)

❌ DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW ❌

This Discord authentication verifies that on which discord servers you are, if you are on a server that is on the bot's blacklist, you will not be able to use it.
Also check the role you have on discord. Click on authorize to complete the Authorization.

If we get this page it means that we have been able to authenticate ourselves successfully.
Now log in to the bot.

## Log in
When executing the bot, this window will appear to put our data:

![login](public/login.png)

We can log in with our name and username, or the SID (If you don't know how to use this option, don't use it) and in Saved we can add our data for the bot to save.

When we add a login, the bot gives us the option to add a Master password (you can leave it empty).
