## 3. First run

Run the darkbot by double clicking the Darkbot.jar file. When you do, this verification window will appear:

❌ DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW (Discord Auth) ❌

This Discord authentication verifies on which discord servers you are, if you are on a server that is on the bot's blacklist, you will not be able to use it.
Also checks the role you have on our discord server. Click on authorize to complete the Authorization.

If we get this page then it means we have been able to authenticate ourselves successfully.
Now log in to the bot.
